<h1>Overview</h1>
<b>🐀You’re a down-on-your-luck rat who made one very bad deal with the Rat Mafia 💼.

🍪Now, buried in debt and cornered by crooks, your only way out is to gamble for cookies… because in the underworld, cookies are currency 💸.

🐀At the end of the line, you’ll gamble it all against the Rat Mafia Boss.
One last hand… one last cookie… one last chance at financial freedom 👑 .

🍪Will you claw your way out of debt, or will the mob bury you under a mountain of crumbs? ⚰️</b>
