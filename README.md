  <img width=200px align="left" src=https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyOTc2MDY5LnBuZw==/original/7pJkfp.png>

  You’re a down-on-your-luck rat who made one very bad deal with the Rat Mafia.<br/>
  Now, buried in debt and cornered by crooks, your only way out is to gamble for cookies… because in the underworld, cookies are currency.<br/>
  At the end of the line, you’ll gamble it all against the Rat Mafia Boss.
  One last hand… one last cookie… one last chance at financial freedom.<br/>
  Will you claw your way out of debt, or will the mob bury you under a mountain of crumbs?
