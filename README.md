<h1>ðŸ“š Overview</h1>
Youâ€™re a down-on-your-luck rat who made one very bad deal with the Rat Mafia.<br/>
Now, buried in debt and cornered by crooks, your only way out is to gamble for cookiesâ€¦ because in the underworld, cookies are currency.<br/>
At the end of the line, youâ€™ll gamble it all against the Rat Mafia Boss.
One last handâ€¦ one last cookieâ€¦ one last chance at financial freedom.<br/>
Will you claw your way out of debt, or will the mob bury you under a mountain of crumbs?
