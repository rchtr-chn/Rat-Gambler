<h1>📚 Overview</h1>
<b>You’re a down-on-your-luck rat who made one very bad deal with the Rat Mafia.<br/>
Now, buried in debt and cornered by crooks, your only way out is to gamble for cookies… because in the underworld, cookies are currency.<br/>
At the end of the line, you’ll gamble it all against the Rat Mafia Boss.
One last hand… one last cookie… one last chance at financial freedom.<br/>
Will you claw your way out of debt, or will the mob bury you under a mountain of crumbs?</b>
